# Bacteria-Vosialization
<p>Using bellybutton data from <a href="http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/">rondunnlabs.com<a>, one can explore a dashboard where each subject's bellybutton biodiversity is displayed.</p>
<p>By selecting a subject from the dropdown, one will be shown the type of bacteria to the right, and below that one can observe the frequency the bacteria appears.
